# Tech Stack Record

A method to record the tech stack for a given repository/project.  The idea originated from the concept of [Architecture Decision Records](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records). When working with several projects or starting a new project it can be difficult to find your way around. What build tools are we using? How do build notifications get sent? What library do we use for logging? for HTTP requests?  Having a simple markdown that lists the tech stack can answer many questions when you are a beginning a project or coming back to a project in a succinct way.
